# Canonicity
A project exploring what makes the literary canon, the literary canon.

## What's Going On Here?
The Canonicity Project is a student research project at SUNY Geneseo exploring the concept of the literary canon. The project has taken off in a couple directions with different focuses:

### 1. What formal features define the canon?

When he writes about the canon, literary critic Harold Bloom suggests that the works he sees as being in the canon are inherently better than those he has left off his list. Pondering why he included some of the works that he did, Bloom states that he has chosen the writers "for both their sublimity and their representative nature," that is because they represent a literary period, style, or place. When considering what makes these writers great Bloom returns a nonanswer: 

>I have tried to confront greatness directly: to ask what makes the author and the works canonical. The answer, more often than not, has turned out to be strangeness, a mode of originality that either cannot be assimilated, or that so assimilates us that we cease to see it as strange.

Essentially, for Bloom their is little in the way of formal rules governing inclusion into the canon. Thus, we wish to learn study whether or not there are any actual formal structures that make a work more or less canonical. Can we measure the aesthetic qualities of a text through its use of formal techniques?

### 2. How has the canon changed over time?

Bloom chooses to divide the temporal structure of his canon into different ages: The Theocratic Age, The Aristocratic Age, The Democratic Age, and The Chaotic Age. He borrows these distinctions from Giambattista Vico and sees them as corresponding both to the literature as well as the general cultural history of the West. The inclusion of defined time periods leads us to question whether the quality of canonicity has itself changed over time. Are the features that make a work of the Theocratic Age canonical the same as those of the Chaotic Age?

Furthermore, we wish to discern whether or not the beggining and end points ascribed to these ages are appropriate from a formal perspective. That is, are there legitimate formal diferences in texts from the different periods? Are there better points in time to mark as the beginning and ends of periods?

### 3. What diferentiates the canon from the rest of literature?

Building on the issues of generating a formal definition for canonicity and identifying changes to the canon over time, we also wish to more concretely than Bloom explore the differences between texts in the canon and texts existing outside of it. We feel it is an essential cultural question to consider why we choose the texts that we do for the canon. While Bloom acknowledges the arbitrariness of his selection process, he leaves much to be desired. The development of a Western canon suggests a ranking and evaluation of texts on aesthetic, formal, and cultural bases. Given that two of those three criteria are incredibly subjective, we wish to acknowledge whether canonical selections are entirely subjective or if there is a formal base for them.

### 4. Can we model formal methods in literature as a dynamic system? 

Looking at formal changes to the canon over time raises the question of whether or not we can actually properly model the dynamics of literature. In particular, we would like to explore whether or not is possible to quantify the effect on subsequent texts of adding certain texts to the literary system. It is our hope that as we explore the other issues we have outlined that the solutions to this issue will become apparent and will scale as we include more and more texts.
